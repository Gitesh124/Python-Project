Working:
Character Pools:
  Uses string.ascii_letters for uppercase and lowercase letters.
  string.digits and string.punctuation provide numbers and special characters, respectively.

Ensure Diversity:
  The script guarantees the password includes at least one letter, digit, and special character.

Randomization:
  Additional characters are chosen randomly from all pools combined.
  The password is shuffled to avoid predictable patterns.

Error Handling:
  Ensures the password length is at least 4 to accommodate one character from each category.
