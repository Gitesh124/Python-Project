How It Works:

Text Input:
	The tk.Text widget is used for multi-line input.

File Operations:
	filedialog.asksaveasfilename and filedialog.askopenfilename are used for saving and opening files.
	Text is written to or read from .txt files.

UI Layout:
	Buttons are placed in a horizontal frame for easy access.
	The main text area expands dynamically with the window size.


Example Usage:

Launch the app, write your diary entry, and click Save Entry.
To view a saved entry, click Open Entry and select a file.
Use Clear Entry to reset the text area.
